title: "Obtained NVIDIA Certification in Data Parallelism"
---

I'm happy to share that I've obtained a new certification: Data Parallelism: How to Train Deep Learning Models on Multiple GPUs from NVIDIA!

This certification deepens my expertise in scaling deep learning workloads efficiently across multiple GPUsâ€”an essential skill for advancing large-scale AI research and engineering.

I'm excited to apply these techniques in my ongoing work on efficient training, distributed computing, and performance optimization.
