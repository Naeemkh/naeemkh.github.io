title: "Benchmarking NVIDIA HPC Workloads on the Kempner AI Cluster is now available"
---

I've published a comprehensive benchmarking study evaluating the NVIDIA HPC workloads on the Kempner AI Cluster. The study covers HPL, HPL-MxP, HPCG, and STREAM benchmarks across multiple GPU configurations.

**[View detailed benchmark results]({% post_url 2025-07-07-nvidia-hpc-benchmarks %})**

The analysis includes:
- HPL performance scaling (1-8 GPUs)
- Mixed-precision HPL-MxP results 
- HPCG memory-bound benchmarks
- STREAM bandwidth measurements
