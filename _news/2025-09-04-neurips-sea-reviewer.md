title: Invited as a Reviewer for the SEA Workshop at NeurIPS 2025
---

I’m pleased to announce that I have been invited to serve as a reviewer for the Workshop on Scientific Exploration with Generative Agents (SEA 2025), held as part of NeurIPS 2025.

The SEA Workshop focuses on advancing the use of generative AI and agent-based systems for scientific discovery and exploration. It provides a forum for researchers to share methods, benchmarks, and ideas that bridge artificial intelligence with the scientific process.

More details about the workshop can be found here:

I’m excited to contribute to the review process and engage with the innovative research that will be presented at SEA 2025 under the NeurIPS umbrella.
