I am a Senior ML Research Engineer at the Kempner Institute at Harvard, specializing in performance and efficiency in machine learning. My work spans large-scale experiments on diffusion models and transformers, performance benchmarking on GPU clusters, and the development of reproducible open-source codebases. I focus on rapidly implementing research ideas, profiling and optimizing bottlenecks, and delivering systems that make AI experiments faster, scalable, and reliable.
