## Abstract

It has become common practice to validate ground‐motion simulations based on a variety of time and frequency metrics scaled to quantify the level of agreement between synthetics and data or other reference solutions. There is, however, no agreement about the importance or weight that it ought to be given to each metric. This leads to their selection often being subjective, either based on intended applications or personal preferences. As a consequence, it is difficult for simulators to identify what modeling improvements are needed, which would be easier if they could focus on a reduced number of metrics. 

We present an analysis that looks into 11 ground‐motion validation metrics using semisupervised and supervised machine learning techniques. These techniques help label and classify goodness‐of‐fit results with the objective of prioritizing and narrowing the choice of these metrics. This work provides an objective framework for selecting the most informative validation metrics in earthquake ground motion simulation.
