## Abstract

We present the results of the application of the active learning method in developing surrogates as physics‐based earthquake ground‐motion simulators. The surrogates, which map input parameters into output values without demanding intensive computations, are an essential part of any parameter optimization, sensitivity, and uncertainty analysis. Artificial neural networks (ANNs), as an example of surrogates, are very effective in estimating any complicated model. ANNs use a set of training data to learn the mapping process. Training data are a set of input parameters and their corresponding output values. 

Generating training data requires conducting numerous regional scale ground‐motion simulations. These numerical simulations are computationally challenging. Therefore, a step‐by‐step learning method should be employed to reduce the need for generating unnecessary training data. We demonstrate how active learning methods can significantly reduce the computational burden while maintaining the accuracy of physics-based ground motion prediction models.
