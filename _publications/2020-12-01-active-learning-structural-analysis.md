## Abstract

A step by step method is presented for reducing the need for a large number of response history analyses (RHAs) in developing surrogates to predict the structural responses. These surrogates, which map ground motions features and characteristics of the structural systems into structural responses, are used in deriving fragility curves; and mostly are developed using machine learning algorithms. A machine learning algorithm, depending on the complexity of the model, requires a sufficient amount of training data to predict the outputs accurately. For complicated structural models, generating training data can be computationally demanding. 

Therefore, there is a need to generate the least amount of training data while preserving the accuracy of the prediction models. Towards this goal, a pool-based query-by-committee active learning (AL) algorithm is applied to choose probably the most informative data samples. The proposed methodology significantly reduces the computational cost of developing accurate surrogate models for structural response prediction.
